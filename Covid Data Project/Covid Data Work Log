Plan: Study covid data across countries to determine which factors, if any, predict covid case rates.

Questions: 
Does population density play a role in covid case rates?
Does government stringency (lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine mandates) play a role in covid case rates?
Does how developed a country is affect covid case rates?

Retrieved data from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Used Excel to split data into 4 data sets:
  1.	Case & Death data
  2.	Test & Vaccine data
  3.	Location & Population data
  4.	Excess Mortality data
Used R to:
  Removed duplicate rows from Location & Population data using R
  Removed rows with no Excess Mortality data using R
Saved as: Covid Data Project Data Cleanup Code.R

Created a Covid Portfolio Project SQL server database on my computer: sqlcmd -S DESKTOP-6TM6V97 -E
Imported data from .CSV files and created tables in the database
•	Used SQL Server Management Studio
•	tests & vaccinations integers needed to be bigint 

4/6/2022
Used Azure Data Studio Explored the data in SQL
Explored Data
Wrote SQL query to remove rows w/ all NULL data in dbo.cases & deaths
Wrote SQL query to replace all NULL values in the [total deaths] column of dbo.cases & deaths with 0
Wrote SQL query to get case rate and death rate per population per country, joined tables, and exported the data to ‘Covid case rate & death rate per population per country.CSV’
Saved SQL Code as: Covid Data Project SQL code.docx
Exported SQL Query Results to: Covid-case-rate-&-death-rate-per-population-per-country.csv

4/7/2022
Imported Covid-case-rate-&-death-rate-per-population-per-country.csv to R
Mutated population_density from character to numeric
Created a function (pdcr_Scatter) to create a scatter plot of population_density v Case_Rate_%_Per_Pop
