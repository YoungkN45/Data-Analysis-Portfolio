I am storing all my .CSV data files here
The original Data file is too big to store

Files slit from original data:
 1. Covid-Case-&-Death-data
 2. Covid-Location-&-Population-Data
 3. Covid-Test-&-Vaccine-Data
 4. Covid-Excess-Mortality-Data

Files created using R to remove duplicate data:
 1. Covid-Location-&-Population-data-small
 2. Covid-Excess-Morality-Data-small
 
Files created from SQL queries:
 1. Covid-case-rate-&-deat-rate-per-population-per-country
